You guys are really cool, and I just think it's a waste you don't know each other!!! 

<br>

Learn how to contribute your art on my [Github](https://github.com/limh0228/schemes_and_machinations), where this website's source code is hosted! Other programming contributions are also welcome. Fix bugs, add buttons, help me make it nice.

## Announcements, Events, Releases, and Drops
This is a section for your releases, events, websites, announcements and new drops. Gatekeeping is for losers.

## Community Discussion
We are facilitating this part through GitHub because I'm too lazy to build backend for this site. Guys, it's literally just a blog; it's not that serious.
