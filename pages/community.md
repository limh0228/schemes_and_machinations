You guys are really cool, and I just think it's a waste you don't know each other!!! 

<br>

Learn how to contribute your art on my [Github](https://github.com/limh0228/schemes_and_machinations), where this website's source code is hosted! Poems, music, photos, everything is welcome. Programming contributions are also welcome. Fix bugs, add buttons, help me make it nice.

## Poems from the Masses (you guys)
<!-- Jekyll builds with version 3.0 and configured with a baseurl, need to prepend post_url or link tags with site.baseurl like below; the links will need to be updated to remove baseurl prefix once Github pages updates its Jekyll version -->

## Announcements, Events, Releases, and Drops
This is a section for your releases, events, websites, announcements and new drops. Gatekeeping is for losers.

## Community Discussion
We are facilitating this part through GitHub because I'm too lazy to build backend for this site. Guys, it's literally just a blog; it's not that serious.
