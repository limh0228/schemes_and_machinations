title: Let's Make Stuff Together
---

This website is a group project. Feel free to contribute your writing or links to stuff you made! Shows, merch, websites, are all welcome. You guys are really cool, and I just think it's a waste you don't know each other!!! Contact me if you'd like to get freaky and make things together. We can jam, or write something together...
My email is Lim.Hannah0228@gmail.com

<br>

Learn how to contribute on my [Github](https://github.com/limh0228/schemes_and_machinations), where this website's source code is hosted! Other programming contributions are also welcome. Fix bugs, add buttons, help me make it nice.
