This is the landing pad for everything I make. Mostly this blog will be about my writing, maybe some music or code, but I also just moved to NYC in October 2024, so there are some resources here for community organizing and making friends. There is also a community board to help you guys get connected with each other and showcase all the cool things you're up to.

<br>

Contact me if you’d like to get freaky and make things together. We can jam, or write something together… My email is Lim.Hannah0228@gmail.com

<br>

This blog is a group project because...we only have each other here on Earth. There's nothing else. Just us. I'm just grateful to be here. I want to be a part of things.
