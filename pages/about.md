This is the landing pad for everything I make. Mostly this blog will be about my writing, maybe some music or code, but I also just moved to NYC in October 2024, so there are also some resources here for community organizing and community building. I want to be your friend.

<br>

Sometimes, practical acts of social activism do really just boil down to making friends, and finding the energy to make their lives better. Not anything so crazy, but like...we only have each other here on Earth. There's nothing else. Just us.

<br>

I'm just grateful to be here.
