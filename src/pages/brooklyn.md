## I love Brooklyn where I live
And I heard you do too! If you want this part of the Earth to be better with you in it, these are easy ways to get involved

## I'm depressed!
Sadness is a kind of telescope which projects you into space, but also make your strangely myopic. When I'm lost in space stuck inside the prison of my self, I like to imagine that the love is leaking out of me leaving a kind of translucent goo on everything I touch. That makes me feel better.

If you too are interested in goo, here are a few ways you can help my community:

### Getting involved with North Brooklyn Mutual Aid

### Getting involved with NYCares

### I want to help, but I also need help
