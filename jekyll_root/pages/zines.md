title: I heard you wanted a copy of my zine because you're literally obsessed with me or something
---

I used to print, fold, and post them all by hand, but as much as I love licking envelopes, I found that this approach was simply not scalable. As such, I am paywalling the physical copies -- I know, fuck, I'm really sorry. 

## Analog Zines
If you donate at least one dollar to the agenda of my choice, click this link to notify me that you're planning on going to heaven. The zine will be mailed to you within a few business days via USPS. Please don't tell me the amounts, it's all based on honor system.

As a final hurrah for my first love, the great city of Seattle, the program of my choice is the University District Food Bank. [Click here to donate](https://www.wagives.org/organization/university-district-food-bank).

Fill out [this form](./jotform.html) to request a zine.
