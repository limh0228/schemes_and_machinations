In my motherâ€™s backyard
in the Californian October,
there is only one spot of shade that is protected all day.

<br>

We put a desk there to make a little room.
Some chairs,
The dog,
A peach, she cuts into seven 
imperfect slices.

<br>

From here, we can see the hummingbirds dancing
in the dome of rain shower blooming up from the garden hose.

<br>

From here, the lemons are hard
and green.
And nothing bad has happened yet.

<br>

So little is needed 
in the light.
