This year, the summer has arrived early. 

<br>

The light, for example, is burning my cheeks at midday already.

And the fig tree’s fruit are swelling fecund with sun-milk,

pregnant with it, so that nectar drips

sweetly through the skin of each perfect berry.

<br>

Also, the dogwoods are in peak bloom. 

The branches: wide, wedding cake tiers, frosted thickly 

with brilliant white flowers. 

The blooms last about six weeks and gradually fade 

to pink, giving a long season of color.

I think they look just like paper. 

The ocean is warmer too,

so that the children at the beach can sit in the lapping tides,

inspecting the sand for unnatural glimmers:

Shells, glass, the like,

and you. Your eyes also are beginning to glimmer 

unnaturally at this time.

Thus nature conspires to please me.

<br>

Yet this year, the summer has deepened me

so that when a wind blows east, my toes 

root stubbornly into the coolness of deep sand

and they resist. They are resisting

in that futile but spirited way 

a young willow on a soft embankment leans 

and leans before it falls. The same way 

you comfort a fussy baby when you are not her mother,

the same way 

you hold yourself.

<br>

This year, I find myself wishing the season would delay a bit longer — 

wishing the ocean a bit colder, and the figs, a bit greener, 

so that I might believe that time is not so dispassionate to me.

Only in the summer, it seems possible to appeal to Time like this: 

“Won’t you just make a small exception for me? 

I have never asked before. I have been very good!”

<br>

For only one moment she holds me in her sympathy dnd

then she forges on. 

She does not look back at me a single time. 

I am left watching the dogwood blossoms gradually fade to pink.
