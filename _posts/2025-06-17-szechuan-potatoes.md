_Ingredients:_
<br>

- Potato (ideally red or gold, avoid russet, high starch varieties)

- 2 cloves of garlic

- 1 quarter inch knob of ginger

- White Vinegar

- Scallions

- Cilantro

- Chinese Vinegar

- Soy Sauce

- Sichaun Red Peppercorns

- Red chili flakes

<br>

_Method:_

<br>

Cut Potatoes into matchsticks (long and skinny). Prepare an icebath with 2 tbsp (approx) white vinegar and 1 tsp (approx) salt. Soak potatoes for 20 min.

<br>

While potatoes are soaking, dry roast the sichuan peppercorn until fragrant and slightly toasted. 

<br>

Ideally take them out and crush them up a little into smaller pieces, but you can skip this step if you’re too lazy too use a knife (like me) or don’t have a mortar and pestle (like me).

<br>

Cut garlic and ginger into thin long strips

<br>

Cut scallions and cilantro to roughly match the size of the potatoes 

<br>

Now comes the main part:

<br>

We will cook our potatoes for a very short total time, less than 5 min. They will be quite al dente and crunchy at the end, which makes them lean refreshing rather than heavy the way potatoes often do.

<br>

Heat a pan to medium high, with some (a tsbp ish) neutral oil. Lightly fry off your aromatics, starting with the ginger for 30 secs, adding in the garlic, and finishing with the chili flakes. The ginger and garlic should not be carmelized; leave them blond, we are just trying to get rid of the raw flavor. 

<br>

Add the potatoes, cook them for 2 ish min. Add the chinese black vinegar and soy sauce at this point. Cook off both for another minute ish. At this point add the sichuan peppercorns. Another 30 secs, then add the scallions. Wait for them to wilt very slightly and then turn the heat off and add the cilantro. It's time to eat :)
