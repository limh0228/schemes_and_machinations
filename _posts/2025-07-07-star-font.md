Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) was a militant trans-socialist activist organization founded by Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P. Johnson in 1970. STAR founded STAR House in the East Village, Manhattan, which was open from November 1970 to July 1971, and provided food and shelter for transgender youth. The new typeface for my website was developed by [Gender Fails Press](https://genderfailpress.info/) in New York City which used the protest material in the photograph above to develop an open source font called Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) Typeface -- available free for download [here](https://genderfailpress.info/PROTEST-FONTS)!
