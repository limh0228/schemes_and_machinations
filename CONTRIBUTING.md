## Contributing Code
A lot of my site looks super uniform because it is heavily based on an open source Jekyll theme called Hitchens. I'd love for it to look more interesting, but don't yet have the web dev skills, so if you'd like to help me build it, I'd be extremely grateful. You can use the below guidelines to contribute. 

### Testing Locally with Jekyll
1. Clone the repository locally
2. Make desired changes
3. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) provided by GitHub to test locally with Jekyll
4. The publishing source of this site is `schemes_and_machinations/jekyll_root` From here, run: `bundle exec jekyll serve
5. View your masterpiece at `http://localhost:4000/`
6. Commit, push and create a pull request against the build branch.
7. Ask me to trigger a build from the build branch to check your work. The website will go live with your changes!
8. Once everything is verified, merge everything into main. Then I'll set the deployment branch back to main. It's a bit hacky, but GitHub pages only allows the build action on the deployment branch, so we ball. MAIN is the verified source of truth.
